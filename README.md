<h1>DHT11/22 temperature-humidity sensor</h1>

<p>STM32 I2C HAL & LL library for the DHT11/22 or AM2302<p>
<p>These sensors are very basic and slow, interval must higher than once per second<p>
<p>This library need to used DwtDelay library as some waiting time need to be in microsecond</p>
<p>Tested on STM32H750 with DHT22</p>
<p>Data are store in data structure</p>
